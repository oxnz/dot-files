    a well-crafted commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to fellow developers
    and indeed to their future selves
    a diff will tell you what changed, but only the commit message can properly tell you why.
    a commit message shows whether a developer is a good collaborator.
    subject -> [{type}] (scopre) summary

    1. separate subject from body with a blank line
    2. limit the subject line to 50 characters
    3. do not end the subject line with a period
    4. use the imperative mood in the subject line
    5. wrap the body at 72 characters
    6. use the body to explain what and why vs. how
